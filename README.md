###Projects as part of CSE535 Information Retrieval Course Work


1. Folder `QuestionAnswering` corresponds to the 4th project of wherin a Question Answering search engine system was built. Twitter data was collected using a REST api called tweepy. Indexing & querying was done on Solr. Used Lucene to experiment with various retrieval models. NLP was done using nltk library.
2. `BooleanQueries.java` corresponds to the project whose overview is as follows 
***In project part two you will be given Lucene index generated from the RCV2 multilingual news corpus [1]. Your first task is to get familiar 
with the Lucene index and learn how to interact with it using Lucene
APIs. Then you need to build your own inverted index using the 
information extracted from the given
data. Your index should be stored as Linked List in memory as the 
examples shown in textbook. After
that, you are required to implement two strategies to return boolean 
query results: term-at-a-time and
document-at-a-time. Java should be used for this project.***
3. `EvaluationOfRetrievalModels.pdf` summarizes the work on experimenting with various retrieval models.
